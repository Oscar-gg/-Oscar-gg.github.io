        "description": "This Hackathon was organized by the Imperial College Business School, Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, and other organizations. For this event, my team and I developed a mobile application using React Native and a database. I was in charge of developing some of the backend and a little bit of the frontend. While working on this project, I realized that I first needed to learn React and Web Development before being able to fully comprehend React Native and thus decided to start learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.",

        "description": "HackMty, the largest student Hackathon in Mexico, was the first event of this type that I was able to attend. As many Hackathons, it consisted of selecting a challenge and developing a solution in less than 24 hours. For this event, my teammates and I chose to create a mobile application to solve a problem related with the management of water, a relevant need at that time because there was a water shortage in Northern Mexico when HackMty took place. For this application we used Kivy, a python framework for mobile apps.",

        "description": "During the first months since joining Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, I started attending weekly meetings organized by some students at campus in which competitive programming problems were analyzed and upsolved. In these meetings, I started learning about data structures and algorithms for solving common problems. In addition, I created an account for codeforces and started uploading my solved problems in a github repository.",

In this competition, where the robot needed to surpass a series of challenges, I was in charge of the programming area and learned about another area of computer science: robotics. An important aspect was to make the code flexible as the components sometimes didn‚Äôt work as expected. E.g. Motors moved at different speeds, voltage could affect results, etc.",

        "description": "After having participated the year before in the competition, hosted by Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, I studied the syntax of both c++ and python to a greater extent and was able to win first place at this coding competition directed to high school students. Learning about the syntax of the languages allowed me to consolidate my foundations and learn about new concepts such as reference variables, ways to format strings, and ‚Äòcomputational thinking‚Äô. From this event I learned that it‚Äôs relatively easy to learn new languages because many of the concepts are transferable.",

        "description": "As part of the Internal Assessment for the IB CS course, I had to develop an application that helped solve a problem of a client of our selection. For this project, I developed a mobile app for android using java. The purpose of the application was to manage a series of tasks and organize them in relation to the category of the task, status, priority, and people related to a given task. The application is able to store, sort, filter, and maintain a log of tasks marked as completed to improve management. From this project, I learned about the system life cycle and mobile development at a fast pace, as well as the importance of taking into account the client‚Äôs opinion.",

After lurking in subreddits related to programming for quite some time, I found limited time coupons to take Al Sweigart‚Äôs ‚ÄúAutomate the boring stuff with python‚Äù for free and get a certification. Learning this language was interesting as it made me reflect about the decisions made when developing languages and the inherent trade offs that those decisions imply, such as speed of developments vs execution time, or dynamic vs static typing.",

This time, the competition was hosted by Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey and it consisted of c++ and python questions. The questions were of type multiple choice and fill in the blanks. From this contest I learned the importance of learning independently, because c++ and python were both languages that I hadn‚Äôt seen in classes and only read of them in my free time; I realized that I had a lot to learn and that there are a lot of interesting technologies out there.",

I decided to make this project relatively close to the date I started programming because I figured out that it would be the fastest way to produce something useful for me, which would in turn motivate me to keep learning. In the end, the script saved me a couple of hours of opening zoom classes and automating basic tasks‚Ä¶ but it took me nearly 15 hours of research, learning and trial and error to produce the script. üòÖ",
