              This Hackathon was organized by the Imperial College Business School, Tecnológico de Monterrey, and other
              organizations. For this event, my team and I developed a mobile application using React Native and a
              database. I was in charge of developing some of the backend and a little bit of the frontend. While
              working on this project, I realized that I first needed to learn React and Web Development before being
              able to fully comprehend React Native and thus decided to start learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

              HackMty, the largest student Hackathon in Mexico, was the first event of this type that I was able to
              attend. As many Hackathons, it consisted of selecting a challenge and developing a solution in less than
              24 hours. For this event, my teammates and I chose to create a mobile application to solve a problem
              related with the management of water, a relevant need at that time because there was a water shortage in
              Northern Mexico when HackMty took place. For this application we used Kivy, a python framework for mobile
              apps.

              This competition consisted of developing a remote-controlled robot using Arduino in teams of 4. In this

              area and learned about another area of computer science: robotics. An important aspect was to make the
              code flexible as the components sometimes didn’t work as expected. E.g. Motors moved at different speeds,
              voltage could affect results, etc.

              After having participated the year before in the competition, I studied the syntax of both c++ and python
              to a greater extent and was able to win first place at this coding competition directed to high school
              students. Learning about the syntax of the languages allowed me to consolidate my foundations and learn
              about new concepts such as reference variables, ways to format strings, and ‘computational thinking’. From
              this event I learned that it’s relatively easy to learn new languages because many of the concepts are
              transferable.

              As part of the Internal Assessment for the IB CS course, I had to develop an application that helped solve
              a problem of a client of our selection. For this project, I developed a mobile app for android using java.
              The purpose of the application was to manage a series of tasks and organize them in relation to the
              category of the task, status, priority, and people related to a given task. The application is able to
              store, sort, filter, and maintain a log of tasks marked as completed to improve management. From this
              project, I learned about the system life cycle and mobile development at a fast pace, as well as the
              importance of taking into account the client’s opinion.

              After having recognized the potential of python in the previous coding competition, I decided to learn by
              taking online courses in my free time and making projects. After lurking in subreddits related to
              programming for quite some time, I found limited time coupons to take Al Sweigart’s “Automate the boring
              stuff with python” for free and get a certification. Learning this language was interesting as it made me
              reflect about the decisions made when developing languages and the inherent trade offs that those
              decisions imply, such as speed of developments vs execution time, or dynamic vs static typing.

              During my sophomore year of high school, I entered my first competition related to coding. This time, the
              competition was hosted by Tecnológico de Monterrey and it consisted of c++ and python questions. The
              questions were of type multiple choice and fill in the blanks. From this contest I learned the importance
              of learning independently, because c++ and python were both languages that I hadn’t seen in classes and
              only read of them in my free time; I realized that I had a lot to learn and that there are a lot of
              interesting technologies out there.

              One of the first scripts that I developed had the purpose of automating a daily task that I inevitably had

              relatively close to the date I started programming because I figured out that it would be the fastest way
              to produce something useful for me, which would in turn motivate me to keep learning. In the end, the
              script saved me a couple of hours of opening zoom classes and automating basic tasks… but it took me
              nearly 15 hours of research, learning and trial and error to produce the script. 😅
